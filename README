= Master and Servant

    Theres a new game
    We like to play you see
    A game with added reality
    You treat me like a dog
    Get me down on my knees
    
    We call it master and servant
    We call it master and servant
    
    Its a lot like life
    This play between the sheets
    With you on top and me underneath
    Forget all about equality
    
    Lets play master and servant
    Lets play master and servant
    
    Its a lot like life
    And thats whats appealing
    If you despise that throwaway feeling
    From disposable fun
    Then this is the one
    
    Dominations the name of the game
    In bed or in life
    Theyre both just the same
    Except in one youre fulfilled
    At the end of the day
    
    Lets play master and servant
    Lets play master and servant
    
    Lets play master and servant
    Come on, master and servant
